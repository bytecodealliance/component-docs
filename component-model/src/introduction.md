The WebAssembly Component Model is a broad-reaching architecture for building interoperable Wasm libraries, applications, and environments.

> â“˜ This documentation is aimed at _users_ of the component model: developers of libraries and applications. _Compiler and Wasm runtime developers_ can take a look at the [Component Model specification](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) to see how to add support for the component model to their project.

## Status

[WASI 0.2.0 was released](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/577) Jan 25, 2024, providing a stable release of WASI and the component model. This [is a stable set of WIT definitions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/main/preview2) that components can target. WASI proposals will continue to evolve and new ones will be introduced; however, users of the component model can now pin to the stable 0.2.0 release.
