# Introduction

This book introduces the WebAssembly Component Model, a broad-reaching architecture for building interoperable Wasm libraries, applications, and environments.

## Who is this book for?

This book is aimed at _users_ of the component model - developers building libraries and applications. It covers how to build Wasm components, and how to use Wasm components to build applications or higher-level libraries.

The book does not cover the _implementation_ of the component model, such as building Wasm runtimes or hosts.

## Status

The component model is a work in progress. Although the architecture is well-defined, details are still evolving. This version of the guide is current as of late August 2023.

## Get started

To get a sense for what the component model is, and what motivates it, see [What is a component?](./what-is-a-component.md).

To dive in to using the component model, see the [Tutorial](./tutorial.md), which walks you through creating components and building an application out of them, or the [Language Guide](./language-support.md), which provides a survey of high-level language tooling for building and consuming components.
