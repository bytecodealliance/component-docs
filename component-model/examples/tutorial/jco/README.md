# Wasm Component Calculator in JavaScript

This is a `node` CLI and browser based example implementation of running a component that exports the `calculate` interface from a JavaScript application. It uses [`jco`](https://bytecodealliance.github.io/jco/) to generate JavaScript bindings and shows how the same component can be executed in the browser or locally with Node. For another example of using `jco` with components in multiple environments, see the [`jco` example](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/blob/main/docs/src/example.md).

```sh
# Wasm referenced here was generated by the Rust WebAssembly toolchain.
# See top-level README for commands to generate it.
#
# We want to *omit* wasm requiring Wasi,
# thus use `composed.wasm`, not the `command.wasm`. 

# Transpile to generate bindings for JS:
jco transpile ../composed.wasm -o bindings

# Serve required files (index.html & jco generated files minimally):
npx live-server .

# Run CLI example:
node cli-calc.js
```
