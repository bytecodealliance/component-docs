# Wasmtime

[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/) is the reference implementation of the Component Model. It supports running components that implement the [`wasi:cli/command` world](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cli/blob/main/wit/command.wit) and serving components that implement the [`wasi:http/proxy` world](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/blob/main/wit/proxy.wit). Wasmtime can also invoke functions exported from a component.

## Running command components with Wasmtime
To run a command component with Wasmtime, execute:

```sh
wasmtime run <path-to-wasm-file>
```

> If you are using an older version of `wasmtime`, you may need to add the `--wasm component-model` flag to specify that you are running a component rather than a core module.

By default, Wasmtime denies the component access to all system resources. For example, the component cannot access the file system or environment variables. See the [Wasmtime guide](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/) for information on granting access, and for other Wasmtime features.

## Running HTTP components with Wasmtime

You can now execute components that implement the [HTTP proxy world](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/blob/main/wit/proxy.wit) with the `wasmtime serve` subcommand. [The Wasmtime CLI](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) supports serving these components as of `v14.0.3`. 

To run a HTTP component with Wasmtime, execute:
```sh
wasmtime serve <path-to-wasm-file>
```

Try out building and running HTTP components with one of these tutorials

2. [HTTP Auth Middleware tutorial](https://github.com/fermyon/http-auth-middleware#running-with-wasmtime) - compose a HTTP authentication middleware component with a business logic component

## Running components with custom exports
As of Wasmtime Version 33.0.0, there is [support for invoking components with custom exports](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/invoking-component-functions-in-wasmtime-cli).


As an example, if your component exports a function `add` which takes two numeric arguments, you can make use of this feature with the following command.

```sh
wasmtime run --invoke 'foo(1, 2)' <path-to-wasm-file>
```
Make sure to wrap your invocation in single quotes abd to include parentheses, even if your function doesn't take any arguments.
