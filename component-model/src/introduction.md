The WebAssembly Component Model is a broad-reaching architecture for building interoperable Wasm libraries, applications, and environments.

> â“˜ This documentation is aimed at _users_ of the component model: developers of libraries and applications. _Compiler and Wasm runtime developers_ can take a look at the [Component Model specification](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) to see how to add support for the component model to their project.

## Status

The component model is a work in progress. Although the architecture is well-defined, details are still evolving. This version of the guide is current as of late August 2023.
