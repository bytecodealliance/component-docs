# Authoring Components

You can write WebAssembly core modules in a wide variety of languages, and the set of languages that can directly create components is growing. See the [Language Support](../language-support.md) section for information on building components directly from source code.

If your preferred language supports WebAssembly but not components, you can still create components using the [`wasm-tools component`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wit-component) tool.  (A future version of this page will cover this in more detail.)
