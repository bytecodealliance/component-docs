Interested in adding another language to this list? Create a PR to this [document](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/component-docs/blob/main/component-model/src/language-support/other-languages.md) that adds an entry with the following information:

- Language name as a level 3 header
- Link to the project page on Github page
